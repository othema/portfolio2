**Hello world!** ...and welcome to my new blog.

Here, I will be posting weekly about the latest tech news and also writing tutorials on whatever I am working on at the moment. Expect quick tutorials, in-depth articles, and handy tips to level up your tech skills.

New posts drop every week. I am very excited to start this journey and I am sure I will learn lots along the way.

Stay curious,<br/>
Daniel
